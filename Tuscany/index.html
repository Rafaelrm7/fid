<h1>Adventures in Tuscany</h1>
<p>This is a short chronicle of my visit to Italy. Click on the thumbnails to see a larger view of each photograph. Enjoy!</p>

<h2>Pozzarello</h2>
<p><a href="window.html"><img src="thumbnails/window_thumb.jpg" alt="view from the bedroom window" width="75" height="100"></a> The house we stayed in was called Pozzarello and it was built around the year 1200 as the home of the gardner who tended the grounds of the adjacent castle. The thick walls kept us nice and cool inside, despite the blistering mid-day heat. This is the view from our bedroom window.</p>

<h2>The Tuscan Countryside</h2>
<p><a href="countryside.html"><img src="thumbnails/countryside_thumb.jpg" "alt="view from the countryside" width="100" height="75"></a> This is the scene on the way to Montalcino (all roads lead to Montalcino!). It looks a lot like the scene on the way to Sienna, and the scene on the way to the grocery store. We were surrounded by beautiful countryside for most of our travels.</p>

<h2>Sienna</h2>
<p><a href="sienna.html"><img src="thumbnails/sienna_thumb.jpg" "alt="view from the sienna" width="100" height="75"></a> The closest city to our villa was Sienna, about 30 minutes away. We spent many days exploring the steep and crooked streets, sampling the local cuisine at outdoor restaurants, and stopping in the dark and echoey Duomo to escape the sun.</p>

<h2>Lavender</h2>
<p><a href="lavender.html"><img src="thumbnails/lavender_thumb.jpg" "alt="lavender" width="100" height="75"></a> As you can see these are beautiful tall lavender plants and they have a great scent as well. There is a lot more to discover from them.</p>

<h2>Sweets</h2>
<p><a href="sweets.html"><img src="thumbnails/sweets_thumb.jpg" "alt="sweets" width="100" height="75"></a> Don’t even get me started on the sweets. There are all kinds of delicious sweets in Italy. This is something you really wouldn’t want to miss if you ever come visit Italy.</p>

<h2>Cathedral</h2>
<p><a href="cathedral.html"><img src="thumbnails/cathedral_thumb.jpg" "alt="cathedral" width="100" height="75"></a> The Cathedral is one of the most beautiful buildings that I have ever seen. I really love the design of it and how enormous it is. This is another place that you cannot miss when you go and visit Italy.</p>
